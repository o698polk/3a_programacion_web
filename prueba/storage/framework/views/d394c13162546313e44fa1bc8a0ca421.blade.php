## PHPUnit Core

- This application uses PHPUnit for testing. All tests must be written as PHPUnit classes. Use ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___{{ $assist->artisanCommand('make:test --phpunit {name}') }}___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ to create a new test.
- If you see a test using "Pest", convert it to PHPUnit.
- Every time a test has been updated, run that singular test.
- When the tests relating to your feature are passing, ask the user if they would like to also run the entire test suite to make sure everything is still passing.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files, these are core to the application.

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests, using an appropriate filter, before finalizing.
- To run all tests: ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___{{ $assist->artisanCommand('test') }}___SINGLE_BACKTICK___.
- To run all tests in a file: ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___{{ $assist->artisanCommand('test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php') }}___SINGLE_BACKTICK___.
- To filter on a particular test name: ___SINGLE_BACKTICK___{{ $assist->artisanCommand('test --filter=testName') }}___SINGLE_BACKTICK___ (recommended after making a change to a related file).
